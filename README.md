## How it works🔍
- first, the program asks you to enter the number of sides and the length for each side
- based on the input, the turtle calculates the right angle to create a closed shape and begins drawing by looping through each side
- after completing a shape, the turtle’s color changes

## Play around🎨
- try different numbers for sides, like 3 for a triangle, 5 for a pentagon
