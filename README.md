## Features✨
- by clicking anywhere on the screen, you can prompt the program to ask for the number of sides and side length to create a polygon

## Installation💻

- you need to import the turtle module

## How it works🔍
- when you click anywhere on the screen, the program asks you to enter the number of sides and the length for each side
- based on the input, the turtle calculates the right angle to create a closed shape and begins drawing by looping through each side
- after completing a shape, the turtle’s color changes
- the shape is redrawn every time you click on the screen

## Play around🎨
- try different numbers for sides, like 3 for a triangle, 5 for a pentagon
- change the length of each side
